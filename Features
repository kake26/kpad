# Planned additions

1. Showing Braces
2. Tab indentation
3. Showing closing braces
4. Showing close strings

Also any other useful stuff that I might find the editor to be capable of. Point is not to recreate the gambas IDE, but make a nice
little text editor type thing that lends itself to coding as well.
